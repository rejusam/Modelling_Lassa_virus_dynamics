# Lassa Virus Dynamics in West African Rodents

This repository contains the code and data associated with the study titled "Modelling Lassa virus dynamics in West African Mastomys natalensis and the impact of human activities" by Reju Sam John, Hammed Olawale Fatoyinbo, and David T S Hayman.

## Study Overview

Lassa fever is a rodent-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. The study aimed to investigate the seasonal dynamics of Lassa virus (LASV) in its rodent host, Mastomys natalensis, and evaluate how changes in host dynamics, such as those induced by climate change or land-use change, might impact viral persistence and dynamics.
